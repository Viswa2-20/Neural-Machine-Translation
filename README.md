# Neural-Machine-Translation
This project implements Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with Attention. NMT is a deep learning model used to translate sequences (such as sentences) from one language to another. In this case, the task is translating dates from various natural language formats into a standardized machine-readable format (YYYY-MM-DD).
